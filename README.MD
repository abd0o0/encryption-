Encryption Project
Overview
The encryption- repository contains tools and implementations for various encryption algorithms, designed to demonstrate secure data handling and cryptographic techniques. This project showcases practical applications of encryption for educational purposes, including symmetric and asymmetric algorithms, hashing, and secure communication protocols. It is intended for developers and learners exploring cryptography in software engineering.
Features

Implementation of common encryption algorithms (e.g., AES, RSA, SHA-256).
Modular code structure for easy experimentation and extension.
Example scripts for encrypting/decrypting data.
Lightweight and beginner-friendly for learning cryptographic concepts.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

Python 3.8+ (or specify your language, e.g., Java, C++).
Required libraries: 
pycryptodome for Python-based encryption (install via pip install pycryptodome).
(Add other dependencies based on your project, e.g., OpenSSL for C++).


Git for cloning the repository.

Installation

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/abd0o0/encryption-.git
cd encryption-


Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt  # If using Python


Usage

Run the main encryption script:python encrypt.py --input "Hello, World!" --key "mysecretkey"

This encrypts the input string using the specified key (example uses AES).
Decrypt the output:python decrypt.py --input "<encrypted_text>" --key "mysecretkey"


Explore example scripts in the /examples folder for specific algorithms (e.g., RSA key generation, SHA-256 hashing).

See docs/ for detailed guides on each algorithm.
